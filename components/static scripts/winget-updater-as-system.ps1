# PowerShell Script for Silent Winget Updates via TRMM
# ----------------------------------------------------
# This script is designed to run as SYSTEM. It will:
# 1. Create a log file in the tactical agent directory.
# 2. Locate the winget.exe executable.
# 3. Attempt to self-update winget to the latest version.
# 4. Update winget sources.
# 5. Fetch all available upgrades, filter if exclusions.
# 6. Upgrade remaining applications one-by-one.
# 7. Log all output and a final summary report to a transcript file.
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Arguments: "-ExcludeMicrosoft", "-ForceUpgrade", "-IncludeUnknown", "-AdditionalExclusions inkscape.inscape"
# ----------------------------------------------------
# What doesn't work:
# Upgrade that requite to be uninstalled before reinstalling. i.e. Major updagrade.
